# Building a Secure Authentication System with Angular, ASP.NET Core API, and SQL Server
--Overview
I’m excited to share a project I recently developed—a secure authentication system that provides seamless Sign In and Sign Up functionality. Built with a modern tech stack, this system ensures a smooth and secure user experience.

--Tech Stack
Frontend: Angular – for a dynamic and responsive UI.
Backend: ASP.NET Core API – for secure and scalable server-side logic.
Database: SQL Server – for efficient and reliable data storage.
--Features
 Secure and seamless user authentication.
 Clean and user-friendly interface.
 Scalable architecture, designed for future enhancements.

--Future Enhancements
 Authorization: Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions effectively.
 Dashboard: Developing an intuitive dashboard for better data visualization and user interaction.
 
--Key Takeaways
 Strengthened my integration skills between Angular and ASP.NET Core API.
 Gained deeper insights into database operations and optimizations using SQL Server.
Enhanced my understanding of application security best practices.

I’m excited about the progress so far and look forward to expanding the project further!
